# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.0.15] - Unreleased

### Added

- Alerts! This is a new top-level data type. "Alerts" are created as part
  of the analysis phase. 

- Alerts are exposed in the query model as a top-level type "alerts"

- Alerts are exposed in the Explore view - they're the new default and the
  "Recent Alerts" filter is automatically applied at launch

- The filter frame in Explorer is now collapsible. Use ctrl-f to expand and collapse.

- New "Views" block in Explorer. Press 'V' at any time to bring up a list of selectable
  pre-configured views. Each top-level type will show, at the top of the window, what
  the last selected view was. Selecting a view applies that view's filters and column
  characteristics to the window

### Changed

- Scan parameters and default modes changed. The hash default is now equivalent to
  "hash all" and all items will be hashed. Override options are now no-hash and
  hash-new. Validate new or changed is now the default. Override options are
  no-validate and validate-all.

- Moved all input boxes from tui-input to tui-text area. This helps with cursor
  display in editable fields and also provides more stand text box behaviors

## [v0.0.14] - 2025-05-07

### Fixed

- On Windows, key release events weren't filtered out so a single key press
  and release appeared as double-press events

## [v0.0.12] - 2025-05-07

### Added

- Explicit ordering in Explorer! The column view now supports pressing 'a' for
  "ascending" and 'd' for "descending. It also supports left and right arrow for
  cycling through the options. If you want to order on multiple columns, 
  those columns must be displayed in the order that you want the directives 
  applied. Use '+' and '-' to re-order columns. If order is specified on a 
  hidden column, that order is ignored. 

- Some schematized fields weren't available for query in CLI or Explore. All fields
  are now available. New fields include is_undelete, last_hash_scan_old
  hash_old, hash_new, last_val_scan_old

- Explore columns now use shortened display names which are acronyms in the case
  of very long field names. For example, last_val_scan_old is LVSO

- Documentation update to include all available schema fields in the "book"

### Fixed

- Corrected "not_null" to "not null" in Explorer filter tips

- In Explorer, date filter values are validated before the filter is saved.
  Previously, dates were parsed but not actually validated so values such as
  "2025-01-32" would slip past the parser and into the query

- Fixed panic occurring when the window width was too small to display the
  vertical scrollbar in the grid

### Changed

- Cleaned up StringFilter - enum types have had their own filter type for
  a while but StringFilter still had legacy enum validation logic

- Internal cleanup of Explore's "column" data structures. Collapsed
  ColumnOption and ColumnInfo

- Grid rows are no longer cloned prior to drawing the table. The rows
  are re-created (no way to avoid this while using table state) but the
  String contents are no longer cloned

## [v0.0.11] - 2025-05-05

### Added

- New feature: Explore. This is a complete terminal-UI experience for exploring
  FsPulse data. View Items, Changes, Scans, Roots. Create and modify query filters.
  Show and hide columns. Implemented with Ratatui. More coming soon!

## [v0.0.10] - 2025-04-26

No code changes in this release - just pushing out a couple of changes to address
issues with recommended queries.

### Fixed

- A couple of additional issues with queries recommended after scans


## [v0.0.9] - 2025-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with string property definitions in query grammar which case val_error_old and
  val_error_new to be unrecognized

- Fixed issues with recommended queries in scan reports

## [v0.0.8] - 2025-04-23

### Changed

- Fix a few missed references to MD5 in doc book and CLI help

## [v0.0.7] - 2025-04-23

### Changed

- The default hashing function has been changed to SHA2. This will cause previously hashed 
  files to appear changed due to the different algorithm. If you really
  want to stick with MD5, you can set the hash function via config, which is detailed
  in documentation.

### Added

- Config [analysis]\hash with allowable values of "md5" and "sha2". If not specified, "sha2" will be used.
  Note: see documentation on config.
