{"id":"fspulse-bum","title":"Migrate Scanner to Task trait","description":"Extract Scanner into a proper Task trait implementation. This will allow the generic task model to be fully utilized. The Task trait skeleton exists in src/task/task.rs but has no methods defined yet. Scanner currently uses TaskProgress directly but should implement Task interface for consistency with future task types (Export, Maintenance, etc.).","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T16:08:26.655663-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-09T16:09:56.942802-08:00"}
