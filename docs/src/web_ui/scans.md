# Scans

The Scans page displays a history of all completed and in-progress scans.

## Scan History

The page shows a paginated table of scans with key information:

- **Scan ID** and associated root
- **Start and end times**
- **State** (Completed, Stopped, Error)
- **Item counts** (files, folders, total size)
- **Change counts** (additions, modifications, deletions)
- **Alert count** (validation failures, suspicious hash changes)
- **Scan options** (whether hashing and validation were enabled)

## Use Cases

- **History review**: See all past scans and their results at a glance
- **Trend awareness**: Notice patterns in change counts or alert frequency across scans
- **Troubleshooting**: Identify scans that stopped or errored

> **Note**: For real-time monitoring of active scans, see the [Tasks](tasks.md) page. For scheduling and root management, see [Monitor](monitor.md).
