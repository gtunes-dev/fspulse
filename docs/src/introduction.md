FsPulse is a Rust-based command-line tool designed to capture and analyze directory states, detect changes over time, validate file integrity and formats, and query results using a powerful and intuitive query syntax.

## Key Capabilities

- **Directory Scanning** — Track additions, deletions, and modifications of files and directories.
- **Content Validation** — Validate file formats such as FLAC, JPEG, GIF, BMP, PNG, TIFF, and PDF.
- **MD5 Hashing** — Optionally detect file content changes beyond metadata.
- **Powerful Querying** — Access scan results directly with flexible, SQL-like queries.
- **Interactive Mode** — Navigate and explore scan results using a menu-driven shell interface.

FsPulse is designed to scale across large file systems while maintaining clarity and control for the user.
