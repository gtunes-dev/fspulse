# Command-Line Interface

FsPulse is designed with the web UI as the primary interface for all users. However, the CLI provides powerful capabilities for expert users who prefer terminal workflows, automation, and scripting integration.

## CLI Purpose and Limitations

**What the CLI Provides:**
- Query and analyze scan data
- Generate formatted reports
- Automate data analysis workflows
- Integrate with scripts, cron jobs, and CI/CD pipelines

**Important Limitation:**
All **scanning operations** must be performed through the web UI. Start the server with `fspulse serve` and use the [Web Interface](web_ui.md) to configure and run scans. The CLI provides access to query and analyze data generated by scans, but cannot initiate scans.
